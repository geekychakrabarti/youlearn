# YouLearn — Distraction-free learning

**YouLearn** is a local-first video learning tool that lets you study YouTube videos without the algorithm pulling you away. Build a curated library, take timestamped notes, search transcripts, and let AI suggest what to learn next — all stored on your own machine.

> Inspired by [Longcut](https://github.com/SamuelZ12/longcut) and [longcut.ai](https://www.longcut.ai)

- **What's next?** — AI-powered suggestions for what to learn next based on your questions and watched videos
- **Theatre mode** — Full-width video (T key) with no distractions

## Requirements

- macOS 12+ (Windows support coming)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — Python package manager
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) — for video downloads
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) *(optional)* — for AI features

---

## Quick Start

### Option A — Mac App (recommended)

1. Download and open the `YouLearn.app` bundle
2. On first launch, macOS may show a security warning (app is unsigned): **Right-click → Open → Open**
3. YouLearn appears in your menu bar — the server starts automatically and your browser opens

### Option B — Terminal

```bash
# 1. Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 2. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youlearn.git
cd youlearn

# 3. Install ffmpeg
brew install ffmpeg

# 4. Run
bash run.sh
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit as needed:

```json
{
  "video_folder": "~/Movies/YouLearn",
  "video_quality": "720",
  "db_path": null,
  "youtube_api_key": null
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `video_folder` | `~/Movies/YouLearn` | Where downloaded videos are stored |
| `db_path` | same folder as videos | Path to SQLite DB. `null` = use video folder. |
| `video_quality` | `720` | Download quality: `360`, `480`, `720`, `1080` |
| `youtube_api_key` | `null` | Optional. Enables view counts and native sort. Get one free at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) |

**Via menu bar:** Click the YouLearn icon → **📁 Set Storage Location…** to choose a folder with a native macOS picker.

## AI Features (Ollama)

AI features are optional and run fully locally — no data leaves your machine.

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.com
# 2. Pull the model (we use gemma3 — no Meta/Llama models)
ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

Once running, YouLearn automatically uses Ollama for:
- **Semantic tags** — topic tags generated from transcripts
- **Chapter summaries** — hover over a chapter to see a summary
- **What's next?** — AI-suggested next topics based on your questions and watched videos

If Ollama is not running, these features show a clear install message and everything else works normally.
